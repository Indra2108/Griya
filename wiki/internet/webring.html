                <p>A webring (or web ring) is a collection of websites that are all linked together in a circle. They
                    were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, before search engines were as good as they are today.</p>

                <p>Webrings are a great way to find websites that are related to your interests. They are also a good
                    way to get traffic to your own website. When you join a webring, your website will be linked to all
                    of the other websites in the ring. This means that people who are visiting other websites in the
                    ring may also visit your website.</p>

                <p>Here is my suggested webring: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com/" target="_blank">XXIIVV Webring</a> - This webring is all
                        about inspiring artists & developers to build their websites and share traffic amongst each
                        other.</li>
                </ul>
