## Motivation

Initially, I built my personal website just for my portfolio. but after I read a bit about Benhoyt's essay about the [small web](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/), I became intrigued by the idea of making my personal website more extensive, not just limited to being a portfolio but as a place for my creativity.

## Development Status

This site is going to be rewritten with [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/).
