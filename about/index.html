            <h2>Me</h2>

            <p>I'm Indra Damar Jati (<em>kunya</em> <span id="arab">ابو الحسن</span>). I am a Software Developer who
                specializes in Mobile Development based in
                Yogyakarta,
                Indonesia.</p>
            <p>I wrote my first line of code while still in vocational high school. I managed to learn to write Batch
                Scripts in Windows.</p>
            <p>Currently, I&#39;m studying and mentoring at <a href="https://pondokteknologi.com/"
                    target="_blank">Pondok Teknologi</a> (formerly <a href="https://pesantrenit.com"
                    target="_blank">Pesantren
                    IT</a>), an
                informal education in Yogyakarta that focuses on IT skill development and Islamic education. There,
                I am
                entrusted to be a React Native Mentor, responsible for guiding santri in building mobile
                applications,
                especially for Android.</p>
            <p>Besides coding, another thing I enjoy is writing. I love jotting down my thoughts and ideas in
                physical
                journals, like books, or digital platforms such as knowledge bases or blogs.
            </p>

            <p>Anyway, I have some interests, if you're curious:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Functional Programming (FP) such as Haskell (mostly), Lisp-family, and Scala. I love the
                    straightforwardness
                    and simplicity of FP.</li>
                <li>Decentralized internet. such as Indie Web, Webrings, and everything in-between. because <a
                        href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">small web is
                        beautiful</a>.</li>
                <li>Retro computing. such as emulation, old hardware, and the like. (even I still don't know how a
                    computer 'exactly' works, but ironically, I still love this topic, haha). Anyway, I have a Nintendo
                    DS in my home, and I'm planning to make a little research about <a
                        href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uxn</a>,
                    and running it through my DS for learning purpose.
                </li>
                <li>Low-tech. since I've read a bit about <a
                        href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.codeberg.page/articles/frugal-computing/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Frugal computing</a> and <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Low-tech magazine</a> and then seen the
                    environmental
                    conditions in
                    my country, I have become more aware of the environment.</li>

            </ul>

            <p>I have a telegram channel, <a href="https://t.me/NaNreading" target="_blank">@NaNreading</a>
                which is a curated list of articles or websites with blogs worth reading. I created it to improve
                writing skills because I believe that <em>The More You Read, The More You Write...</em></p>

            <p>And lastly, here's my <a href="https://twitter.com/Indradamarj" target="_blank">twitter</a>.</p>

            <h2>Site</h2>
